# Path-Planning-with-Mirobot
# Manipulating 6-DOF Robotic Arm with Inverse Kinematics

This repository contains the complete path planning with Mirobot Manipulator arm. The project explores the design, modeling, control, and execution of trajectory-based manipulation tasks using a 6-DOF robotic arm and gesture-based control methods. The end goal is to **demonstrate joint-space and cartesian space path planning**, validated using **CoppeliaSim** and the **Mirobot platform**.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into 3 main tasks:

### Task 1: Kinematic Modeling
- Defined the modified Denavit-Hartenberg (mDH) table for a 6R-R robot arm.
- Built a simulation skeleton using CoppeliaSim, including collision boxes and a custom gripper model.
- Visualized the robotâ€™s kinematic structure with and without an end-effector.

### Task 2: Joint Space Trajectory Planning

- Defined a series of joint space key poses for the robot.
- Generated a smooth **quintic polynomial trajectory** through the waypoints.
- Simulated trajectory execution in CoppeliaSim and the physical Mirobot.
- Compared results against B-spline trajectories.

- Developed custom Newton-Raphson-based inverse kinematics solvers using Jacobian matrices.
- Compared different Jacobian formulations (6x6, 12x6, 4x6) and discarded non-optimal strategies.
- Implemented velocity and joint angle limit checks to ensure safe control.
- Plotted joint trajectories and validated accuracy.
